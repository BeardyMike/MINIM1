 A clean PHP application, with diagnostic and setup tools, plenty of example pages, and many handy functions built in.
<br> Ideal for PHP beginners, or someone looking for a clean starter MVC-pattern project.
 
 MINIM1 is an based on [MINI3](https://github.com/panique/mini3), from [Panique](https://github.com/panique). This project allows for much deeper customisation, and includes a number of new features that wouldn't make sense in the regular MINI3 project.

 In the _Tools folder you'll find a number of useful tools, including a Python NameSpace Renamer, a Python Crawler for highlighting routing errors, and a full dummy SQL DB for you to import for testing purposes.

## Commenting
This project uses the [PHP-FIG](https://www.php-fig.org/) standard for commenting code, and we've taken great effort to show how and why each function is used.
If you find a comment that needs amending, please feel free to submit a pull request to the dev branch. We want MINIM1 comments to be easy to read, helping new users understand why functions work the way they do.

## Installation
Open a terminal and use "composer install", this creates the VENDOR folder with all the dependencies. 
### THE PHP APPLICATION WILL NOT WORK UNLESS YOU PERFORM THIS STEP.

## What's new?
Simplified installation process, using composer install. Protected view() function in the Controllers with a variable passing examples on all routes ($PageTitle in the header.php)

## Why not just fork MINI3?
We wanted to create a version of MINI3 that was more customisable, included a number of new features, and that is a signifacnt depatrure from MINI3's goals of being super simple/lightwieght. We also wanted to create a version that was more suited to our needs, and that we could use as a base for future projects. 

We also want MINIM1 to be an easier starting point for PHP beginners who are trying to learn the MVC pattern.
